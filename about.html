			<h1>Where it all started...</h1>
			<p>Technology has been a staple throughout my childhood from Playstation1 to Gameboy and Mario, I have grown up with technology integrated into my everyday life and my growing passion for it has driven me into my chosen field of Computer Science.  After doing well in Information technology at GCSE I chose to continue into A level by studying BTEC IT and I am so glad I did, my mind has been opened up to so many new possibilities within the area and really sparks my hunger to learn. It was only a year ago when I discovered I have a true talent for programming, I created a simple card game app for an android device. I love the methodical nature of programming and the endless possibilities inspire me to solve all kinds of different problems. I also have a keen eye for design; I studied a diploma in computer based digital media where I discovered my artistic flair. Within this course I learnt how to use Adobe Photoshop, I enjoy the logic behind a good composition, understanding how certain colours can draw your eye towards elements and how the eye naturally reads across a page is fascinating. Recently I was selected and commissioned to construct a website for a large local gritting business, I drew upon my knowledge from digital media as well as the skills laid down by computing to help me in my creative practise. I redesigned their image bringing them up to date with modern trends and expectations and used WordPress to programme and integrate their website).</p>

			<h1>And then...</h1>
			<p>After my college degree I pursued an apprenticeship in software development instead of going to University as I felt it was the best move for me to learn in a work environment, also I had heard from other apprentices that they had enjoyed there course and were know working in full time development roles. I did my apprenticeship with MrSite where I worked primarily on their website building software called Omnibuilder which was an Angular application where I worked on the backend APIs and services as well as some MVC applications built around the application. I enjoyed my time at MrSite but felt it was time to move on to different challenges.</p>

			<h1>And now</h1>
			<p>Now I'm trying to brush up all of my skills I have learned so far. I would like to focus on Front End Development and the endless possibilities of JavaScript.</p>
